### Instructions:

This work was implemented using the Godot Game Engine. Therefore, to run the source code in your machine, it is recommended that you download the Godot Mono version 3.4. It is expected that its patches (3.4.X) also work. The Engine is available at www.godotengine.org. In order to use this version of Godot, it is necessary to install the Mono Framework, available at www.mono-project.com. After that, clone this repository and open the project file in the Engine. Run the main scene and the test game will run. It is possible to try different parameters for the PSO generation by tweaking the sliders in the test game user interface. If you want to run a batch of simulations with different parameters for the PSO, edit them in the MapGeneratorAnalyzer class within the project and run the AnalysisScene scene from the Godot Editor. The data from the simulations will be stored by default in a file called test.csv.
